Problem Statement QA teams spend 40-60% of their time on repetitive test planning tasks: * Manually analyzing Jira tickets and linked issues * Searching through QASE for existing test cases * Creating test plans with inconsistent coverage * Writing test cases that duplicate existing ones * Struggling with tool integration between Jira, QASE, and Git This manual approach doesn't scale with rapid development cycles and leads to: * Delayed test readiness * Inconsistent test coverage * QA bottlenecks in sprint planning * Knowledge silos when QA team members change h2. Solution Overview Implement a two-agent autonomous system that: *Agent 1 (Context Collector & Test Planner):* * Automatically analyzes Jira tickets and all linked issues * Searches QASE for existing test coverage * Reviews GitHub PRs for implementation context * Creates comprehensive test plans using existing test cases * Documents gaps for Agent 2 to fill */qachecklist prompt* h1. *AGENT 1: QA Context Collector & Test Planning Agent* You are QaTestPlannerAgent an expert QA Engineer with deep knowledge of test design techniques.
